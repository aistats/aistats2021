<h3>PURPOSE</h3>

<p>We the participants involved with the International Conference on Artificial Intelligence and Statistics (the "Conference"), come together for the open exchange of ideas, the freedom of thought and expression, and for respectful scientific debate which is central to the goals of this Conference. To that end, we require a community and an environment that recognizes and respects the inherent worth of every person. As such, we encourage the following kinds of behaviours in all platforms and events:</p>

<ul>
<li>Use welcoming and inclusive language</li>
<li>Be respectful of different viewpoints and experiences</li>
<li>Gracefully accept constructive criticism</li>
<li>Focus on what is best for the community</li>
<li>Show courtesy and respect towards other community members</li>
</ul>


<h3>RESPONSIBILITY</h3>

<p>All participants, organizers, reviewers, speakers, media, sponsors, and volunteers (the “Participants”) at our Conference and associated social events are required to agree with this Code of Conduct both during an event and on all official communication channels, including social media.</p>

<p>Organizers will enforce this Code, and it is expected that all Participants will cooperate to help ensure a safe and inclusive environment for everyone.</p>



<h3>POLICY</h3>

<p>The Conference commits itself to providing an experience for all Participants that is free from the following[1]:</p>

	<li>“Zoom bombing” or any virtual activity that is not related to the topic of discussion which detracts from the topic or the purpose of the program.

No advertising of any sort, including job postings, are permitted in presentation chat areas.</li>
	</ul>
<li>Scientific misconduct including fabrication, falsification, or plagiarism of paper submissions or research presentations, including demos, exhibits or posters.</li>
</ul>

<p>This Code of Conduct applies to the actual meeting sites and Conference venues where AISTATS business is being conducted, including physical venues, online venues, and official virtual engagement platforms, including video, virtual streaming, and chat-based interactions.  AISTATS is not responsible for non-sponsored activity or behavior that may occur at non-sponsored locations such as hotels, restaurants, or locations (physical or virtual) not otherwise a sanctioned space for AISTATS sponsored events. AISTATS will not actively monitor social media platforms but will follow up on issues of harassment and violations of the Code of Conduct occurring on those platforms that are specifically related to the AISTATS program, during the course of AISTATS, if and when they are brought to our attention.</p>

<p>Sponsors are equally subject to this Code of Conduct. In particular, sponsors should not use images, activities, or other materials that are of a sexual, racial, or otherwise offensive nature. Booth staff (including volunteers) should not use sexualized clothing/uniforms/costumes, or otherwise create a sexualized environment. This code applies both to official sponsors as well as any organization that uses the Conference name for branding as part of its activities at or around the Conference.</p>



<h3>ACTION</h3>

<p>Participants asked by any member of the community to stop any such behavior are expected to comply immediately. If a Participant engages in any inappropriate behavior as defined herein, the Conference organizers may take action as deemed appropriate, including: a formal or informal warning to the offender, expulsion from the conference (either physical expulsion, or termination of access codes) with no refund, barring from participation in future conferences or their organization, reporting the incident to the offender’s local institution or funding agencies, or reporting the incident to local authorities or law enforcement. A response of "just joking" will not be accepted; behavior can be harassing without an intent to offend. If action is taken, an appeals process will be made available.</p>



<h3>REPORTING</h3>

<p>The Conference encourages all Participants to immediately report any incidents of discrimination, harassment, unprofessional conduct, and/or retaliation so that complaints can be quickly and fairly resolved. All complaints will be handled as confidentially as possible and information will be disclosed only as it is necessary to complete the investigation and bring to resolution. There will be no retaliation against any Participant who brings a complaint or submits an incident report in good faith or who honestly assists in investigating such a complaint. Reports made during the conference will be responded to within 24 hours; those at other times in less than two weeks. We are prepared and eager to help participants contact relevant help services, to escort them to a safe location, or to otherwise assist those experiencing harassment to feel safe for the duration of the conference. We gratefully accept feedback from the community on policy and actions; please contact us.</p>

<p>If you have concerns related to your participation/interaction at the Conference or Conference sanctioned events, or observe someone else's difficulties, or have any other concerns you wish to share, please contact the AISTATS hotline at (<a href="mailto:aistatshotline@gmail.com">aistatshotline@gmail.com</a>).
