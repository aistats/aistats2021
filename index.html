<p>AISTATS 2020 will be an asynchronous virtual conference where participants will have access to the videos of the keynotes and of the papers to be watched at any time in a virtual webpage. 
   In addition, we will use a chat system in which participants can ask questions in written form to the keynote speakers and to authors. 
   We will also encourage authors to be available for two live Q&A sessions. 
   The videos will be accessible to all participants from around one week before the conference starts, and to everyone else after the conference.
   Registration is now open at <a href="https://www.aistats2020.com/registration/public">AISTATS 2020 Registration</a>

<p> Since its inception in 1985, AISTATS has been an interdisciplinary gathering of researchers at the intersection of artificial intelligence, machine learning, statistics, and related areas.</p>
