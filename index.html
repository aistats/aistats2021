<p>AISTATS 2021 will be an asynchronous virtual conference where
   participants will have access to the videos of the keynotes and of
   the papers to be watched at any time in a virtual webpage.  In
   addition, we will use a chat system in which participants can ask
   questions in written form to the keynote speakers and to authors.
   Keynote speakers and authors will also be available for two live
   Q and A sessions.  The videos will be accessible to all participants
   from around one week before the conference starts, and to everyone
   else after the conference.</p>
