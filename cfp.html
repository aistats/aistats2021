<h1>AISTATS 2020 Call for Papers</h1>

<p>AISTATS is an interdisciplinary gathering of researchers at the intersection of computer science, artificial 
intelligence, machine learning, statistics, and related areas. Since its inception in 1985, the primary goal of 
AISTATS has been to broaden research in these fields by promoting the exchange of ideas among them. We encourage the 
    submission of all papers which are in keeping with this objective at AISTATS.</p>

<h3>Paper Submission:</h3>

<p><b>Proceedings track:</b> This is the standard AISTATS paper submission track. Papers will be selected via
    a rigorous double-blind peer-review process. All accepted papers will be presented at the Conference as
    contributed talks or as posters and will be published in the Proceedings.</p>

<p>Solicited topics include, but are not limited to:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Models and estimation: graphical models, causality, Gaussian processes, approximate inference, kernel methods,
nonparametric models, statistical and computational learning theory, manifolds and embedding, sparsity and compressed 
sensing, ...</p>
<li><p>Classification, regression, density estimation, unsupervised and semi-supervised learning, clustering, topic
models, ...</p>
<li><p>Structured prediction, relational learning, logic and probability</p></li>
<li><p>Reinforcement learning, planning, control</p></li>
<li><p>Game theory, no-regret learning, multi-agent systems</p></li>
<li><p>Algorithms and architectures for high-performance computation in AI and statistics</p></li>
<li><p>Software for and applications of AI and statistics</p></li>
<li><p>Deep learning including optimization, generalization and architectures</p></li>
<li><p>Trustworthy learning, including learning with privacy and fairness, interpretability, and robustness</p></li>
</ul>
<p> For a more detailed list of keywords, please see <a href="keywords.html">here</a>.</p>

<!--<h3>Submission Requirements for Proceedings Track:</h3>

<p>Electronic submission of papers is required. 
Papers may be up to 8 double-column pages in length, excluding references. 
    Authors may optionally submit also supplementary material. 
 Formatting and submission information is available at <a href="submit.html">here</a>.--></p>


<h3>Submission Site</h3>
<p>The submission site is <a href="https://cmt3.research.microsoft.com/AISTATS2020/">
    https://cmt3.research.microsoft.com/AISTATS2020/</a></p>
</p>

<h3>Formatting and Supplementary Material</h3>

<p>Submissions are limited to 8 pages <em>excluding</em> references using the
LaTeX style file we provide below. The number of pages containing citations
alone is not limited. You can also submit a single file of additional
supplementary material which may be either a pdf file (such as proof details)
or a zip file for other formats/more files (such as code or videos). Note that
reviewers are under no obligation to examine your supplementary material. If
you have only one supplementary pdf file, please upload it as is; otherwise
gather everything to the single zip file.  </p>

<p>Formatting information (including LaTeX style files) is <a
href="AISTATS2020PaperPackNew.zip">here</a>. We do not support submission in preparation systems
other than LaTeX. Please do not modify the layout given by the style file. If
you have questions about the style file or its usage, please contact the
publications chair.</p>

<h3>Anonymization Requirements</h3>

<p>The AISTATS review process is double-blind. Please remove all identifying
information from your submission, including author names, affiliations, and any
acknowledgments. Self-citations can present a special problem: we recommend
leaving in a moderate number of self-citations for published or otherwise
well-known work. For unpublished or less-well-known work, or for large numbers
of self-citations, it is up to the author's discretion how best to preserve
anonymity. Possibilities include leaving out a citation altogether, including
it but replacing the citation text with "removed for anonymous submission," or
leaving the citation as-is; authors should choose for each citation the
treatment which is least likely to reveal authorship.</p>

<p>Previous tech-report or workshop versions of a paper can similarly present a
problem for anonymization. We suggest <em>leaving out</em> any identifying information
for such versions, but bringing them to the attention of the program committee
via the submission page. Reviewers will be instructed that tech reports
(including reports on sites such as <a href="http://arxiv.org/">arXiv</a>) and papers in workshops without
archival proceedings do not count as prior publication.</p>

<!--<p>Reviewers may request code and accompanying data as part of the review-->
<!--process. In this case, the authors will be asked to provide this material when-->
<!--they receive their initial reviews, to be submitted at the end of the author-->
<!--response period, in anonymized form (we understand that it might be difficult-->
<!--to remove all traces of the authors from the files, and will not penalize-->
<!--innocent mistakes).  The conference chairs will facilitate the anonymous-->
<!--transfer of code to reviewers. Code and data will only be requested in the-->
<!--event that this is the deciding factor in paper acceptance.  Further, the-->
<!--request should be reasonable in light of the duration of the discussion period,-->
<!--which limits the time available for review.  The SPC member in charge of the-->
<!--paper will confirm whether a code request is warranted and reasonable.</p>-->


<h3>Previous or Concurrent Submissions</h3>

<p>Submitted manuscripts should not have been previously published in a journal
or in the proceedings of a conference, and should not be under consideration
for publication at another conference at any point during the AISTATS review
process. It is acceptable to have a substantially extended version of the
submitted paper under consideration simultaneously for journal publication, so
long as the journal version's planned publication date is in July 2020 or
later, the journal submission does not interfere with AISTATS's right to
publish the paper, and the situation is clearly described at the time of
AISTATS submission. Please describe the situation in the appropriate box on the
submission page (and do not include author information in the submission
itself, to avoid accidental unblinding).</p>

<p>As mentioned above, reviewers will be instructed that tech reports
(including reports on sites such as <a
href="http://arxiv.org/">arXiv</a>) and papers in workshops without
archival proceedings do not count as prior publication.</p>


<p>All accepted papers will be presented at the Conference either as contributed talks or as posters, and will be 
published in the AISTATS Conference Proceedings in the Journal of Machine Learning Research Workshop and Conference 
    Proceedings series.  Papers for talks and posters will be treated equally in publication.</p>
