<h1>AISTATS 2016 Call for Papers</h1>

<p>AISTATS is an interdisciplinary gathering of researchers at the intersection of computer science, artificial 
intelligence, machine learning, statistics, and related areas. Since its inception in 1985, the primary goal of 
AISTATS has been to broaden research in these fields by promoting the exchange of ideas among them. We encourage the 
submission of all papers which are in keeping with this objective at AISTATS.

<!-- <p>This year we will experiment with conditionally accepted papers.  
Authors will get a chance to revise their papers and resubmit, after which the papers will be evaluated by the program committee. </p> -->

<h3>Paper Submission:</h3>

<p><b>Proceedings track:</b> This is the standard AISTATS paper submission track. Papers will be selected via a rigorous double-blind peer-review process. 
All accepted papers will be presented at the Conference as contributed talks or as posters and will be published in the Proceedings. 
<!-- A selected set of papers will be designated as "notable papers" which will be clearly distinguished in the Proceedings. -->

<p>Other tracks will be announced later.

<!--
<p><b>Highlight talks track:</b> We will include talks on recent high-impact work on AISTATS 
themes. This is an opportunity to raise discussion and get additional exposure to work already 
published in journals. The talks will be selected based on one-page 
abstracts and the existing papers, and they do not lead to a paper in the Proceedings.

<p><b>Late-breaking posters track:</b> Some time at the conference will be set aside for "breaking news" posters 
having a one-page abstract. These are reports on ongoing or unpublished projects, projects already published 
elsewhere, partially developed ideas, negative results etc, and are meant as informal forums to encourage discussion. 
The review process of the late-breaking posters will be very light-touch and presentation at the Conference will not 
lead to publication in the Proceedings.
-->

<p>Solicited topics include, but are not limited to:
<ul>
<li>Models and estimation: graphical models, causality, Gaussian processes, approximate inference, kernel methods, 
nonparametric models, statistical and computational learning theory, manifolds and embedding, sparsity and compressed 
sensing, ...
<li>Classification, regression, density estimation, unsupervised and semi-supervised learning, clustering, topic 
models, ...
<li>Structured prediction, relational learning, logic and probability
<li>Reinforcement learning, planning, control
<li>Game theory, no-regret learning, multi-agent systems
<li>Algorithms and architectures for high-performance computation in AI and statistics
<li>Software for and applications of AI and statistics
</ul>
For a more detailed list of keywords, please see <a href="keywords.html">here</a>.


<h3>Submission Requirements for Proceedings Track:</h3>

<p>Electronic submission of papers is required. 
Papers may be up to 
8 double-column pages in length, excluding references. Authors may optionally submit also supplementary material. 
Formatting and submission information is available at <a href="submit.html">here</a>.

<p>All accepted papers will be presented at the Conference either as contributed talks or as posters, and will be 
published in the AISTATS Conference Proceedings in the Journal of Machine Learning Research Workshop and Conference 
Proceedings series.  Papers for talks and posters will be treated equally in publication.


<h3>Submission Deadline:</h3>
