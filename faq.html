<h1>Frequently Asked Questions related to AISTATS 2021 submissions</h1>

<ol>
<li><b>I missed the abstract submission deadline. Can I still submit a full paper?</b></li>
<p><b>Answer:</b> No.  You must submit the abstract in time for the deadline on October 8th.</p>

<li><b>While submitting a paper, do we need to nominate one of the authors as a reviewer?</b></li>
<p><b>Answer:</b> Yes, at least one of the authors must be nominated as a reviewer, you can nominate more than one and we encourage that. If all the authors of the paper are already reviewers or Area Chairs, you do not need to nominate any and you can insert “N/A” in the text box.</p>
<p>Due to the recent increase of submissions, we expect we will need a significantly larger number of reviewers than previous years.  Kindly understand that your nominations will be important to keep the quality of the conference.</p>

<li><b>We want to submit a version of the work to <a href="http://arxiv.org/">arXiv</a>.  Is it allowed?</b></li>
<p><b>Answer:</b> Yes, submission to arXiv is allowed.  However, keep anonymity in the AISTATS submission.  Do not cite the arXiv paper, for example.</p>

<li><b>Can the author list be changed?</b></li>
<p><b>Answer:</b> You can change the author list until the deadline of full paper submission (October 15th).  After this point, any changes to the author list are not allowed.</p>

<li><b>Can I withdraw my submission?</b></li>
<p><b>Answer:</b> Yes. You can withdraw your submission at any point in the reviewing process. For statistical purposes, we will count a submission as “rejected” if it is withdrawn after reviews have been made available to authors.</p>

<li><b>Can we revise the abstract after the abstract deadline?</b></li>
<p><b>Answer:</b> You can revise your abstract before the full paper deadline, but the changes must be minor such as fixing typos or wording.  If the contents or length of the abstract is significantly altered, the submission may be desk-rejected.</p>
