<li>
The major airline serving Reykjavik is 
Icelandair, with direct flights available from a large number of cities in the US and 
Europe. There is also a low-cost airline, WOWair (wow.is) which flies a more limited 
schedule of international flights, but is worth considering if there is an available 
flight that works with your schedule.

<p><b>From the Airport to Reykjavik and the Hotels</b>
<ul>
<li>International flights arrive into Keflavik International Airport.
Its website is
<a href="http://www.airport.is/english">www.airport.is/english</a>

<li>
The airport is about 50 km (40 minutes) from Reykjavik city center. 
It is serviced by a convenient and inexpensive shuttle bus service called 
Flybus (<a href="http://www.flybus.is">flybus.is</a>). Buses depart from the airport to the Reykjavik central bus station 
(BSI) after all arriving flights regardless of the time. Tickets cost 1950 ISK 
(approximately 12 EUR) one way, or 3500 ISK (20 EUR) if you purchase the return ticket 
at the same time. Tickets can be purchased from a counter just as you exit the customs 
area of the airport, and do not need to be purchased in advance.

<li>
From the central bus station (BSI) many hotels are within walking distance, or you can 
catch a taxi to your hotel. Alternately, the Flybus+ service costs 4500 ISK (28 EUR) 
round trip and includes transportation directly to most Reykjavik hotels.

<li>Note that the Grand Hotel where the AISTATS conference will be held is not within 
easy walking distance of BSI, so attendees staying at or near the conference should plan 
to either purchase the Flybus+ option or spend approximately 2000 ISK for a taxi to the 
hotel. It is not advised to take a taxi all the way from the airport in Keflavik, as the 
fare would be very expensive.
